# Binary_search

In python for the presence of an item to be detected in a list, the standard search method compares each element along individually until a match is found. This is viewed as inefficient because of all the caparisons that are made. A binary search is an alternative method that quickly checks and returns the index of the item. It does this by looking at the middle element and identifies if the target is greater or smaller and then searches at side of the list the target is in. This halving of the code is repeated until the target finds a match


This Project runs goes through 1000000 test cases and compares the time the completion of a standard search v a binary search. And helps visualise how much faster a binary search is compared to a native search
